Math exercises and demonstrations

Idea taken from my dear friend [@M42](https://github.com/M42) who started a [math](https://github.com/M42/math) repo containing stuff about maths.

An important problem of studying a Math degree is that most of your work gets lost into your notes. All the time you spent trying to solve certain excercise isn't visible for other people. I hope this repo grows with useful material to others.

# Language

I'll write in both Spanish and English. For example, stuff related to university classes would be usually written in Spanish. On the other hand, machine learning theorical exercises would be written in English most times, because is a little bit difficult to translate the field's own terms to Spanish.
